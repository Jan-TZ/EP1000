        <h4>What I learnt</h4>
        <p>In this class, we learnt about Arduino and TinkerCAD. TinkerCAD is a website where we can simulate our project and code. Although I had prior experience with Arduino, I had not had the same experince with TinkerCAD as this was my first time using it so I had learnt a lot from these lessons. The lecturer taught us how to use TinkerCAD and surprisingly, it was very easy to use. Thus, we beagan experimenting with it. We were first taught to make a simple code that causes an LED to flash on and off, which was relatively easy. Then, we were taught to make slightly harder coing by making a 555 astable timer which is shown below.</p>

        <p>In the next lesson, we were taught more on how to code in which we were assigned the task of making a countdown timer in TinkerCAD. Initially, I had trouble making the circuit start working. After asking the lecturer on why it wasn.t working, I found out that I had the wrong setting for the display where I had it on anode instead of cathode. After that, coding it was relatively simple. The circuit is shown below</p>

        <p>In the lesson after that, we learnt how to code in the input of a button, where we could turn the LED on and off manually. We were taught how to troubleshoot the code making the use of the serial library. We were then given the task of coding 3 different LEDs to go from red to green to white in that order using a button to toggle between the colours. The completed assignment is shown below.</p>

        <p>This assignment is later made in class after we finished the 3D Printing and Lazer Cutting projects and the progress is shown <a href="3.html">here</a>. </p>
        <p>After we finished the 3D Printing and Lazer Cutting projects, we then went on into making the Assignment 12 above and learning about sensors. We were handed temperature and ultrasonic distance sensors and were taught to use it. I first took the ultrasonic sensor and instead of just using the code given, I had integrated it into Assignment 12, where instead of the LED going from red to green to white, it went from red to green to red and green and white only lights up if there is something around 10 to 30cm in front of the ultrasonic sensor. I then did the same for the temperature sensor LM34 that I was given. All three of the circuits' processes can be found <a href="3.html">here</a></p>
